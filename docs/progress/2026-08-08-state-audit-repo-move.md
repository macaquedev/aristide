# 2026-08-08 — state audit after repo move (M1 done, M2 ~70%)

Repo moved from `~/github/aristide` to `/home/macaque/aristide`; full rebuild and
`cargo test --workspace` green here (30 passed, 0 failed).

What exists, by commit history and code review:

- **M0 complete** — workspace scaffold (5 crates), DESIGN.md, GPLv3, CLAUDE.md.
- **M1 complete (code-side)** — `aristide-engine`: fixed 256-voice pool, additive
  principal-chorus test tone, attack/sustain/release envelope, lock-free `rtrb`
  command queue, no alloc/lock/IO on the audio thread. `aristide-server`: cpal
  f32 output, connects every midir MIDI input, note-on/off + CC120–123.
  12-EDO→Hz lives control-side in one function; the engine only sees Hz.
  Audible verification happens on the user's desktop (this box is headless).
- **M2 in progress** — the loader stack is ahead of schedule:
  - `aristide-model`: format-neutral organ model — manuals, stops, ranks,
    pipes with multi-attack (loops, cents offset) and duration-selected
    releases, couplers as key deltas. No 12-EDO in the model.
  - `aristide-formats/wav`: hand-rolled RIFF reader (8/16/24/32-bit int +
    f32, extensible wrapper), `smpl`/`cue` loop metadata, header-only
    `read_info` for future disk streaming. 18 tests.
  - `aristide-formats/wavpack`: minimal libwavpack FFI (no bindgen);
    `wav::read` sniffs `wvpk` magic and delegates. 4 tests.
  - `aristide-formats/grandorgue`: lenient `.organ` ODF parser → model;
    warnings, not errors, for real-world oddities. 8 tests.
    `examples/inspect.rs` prints a set summary.
  - `docs/go-odf-notes.md` (633 lines) — GO format spec notes compiled from
    GrandOrgue's loader source; the authority for parser work.
- **Test fixture**: `testsets/grandorgue-demo/` (gitignored, 21 MB).

Remaining for M2: load the demo set end-to-end through `inspect`, validate
counts/pitches against GrandOrgue's own reading, wire loader warnings into
server startup. Then M3: attack-cache + streaming sampled voices.
