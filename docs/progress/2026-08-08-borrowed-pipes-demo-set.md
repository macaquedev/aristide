# 2026-08-08 — borrowed pipes; demo set loads clean (M2 nearly done)

- Model: `Pipe` now carries an explicit `PipeSource` — `Sampled`,
  `Borrowed(PipeRef)`, or `Silent` — instead of bare attack/release vectors,
  so unit-organ borrowing is a first-class concept. `Organ::sounding_pipe`
  follows borrow chains (hop-capped against cycles).
- GO loader: `REF:<manual>:<stop>:<pipe>` resolved in a deferred pass after
  all stops load (forward references are legal); unresolvable/malformed refs
  and borrow cycles degrade to silent pipes with warnings (GO would abort;
  we stay lenient per the parser's charter).
- `inspect` example reports sampled/borrowed/dead-borrow/silent counts.
- Friesach demo set end-to-end: 3 manuals, 47 stops, 51 ranks, 5 couplers,
  853 sampled + 497 borrowed pipes (all chains terminate on samples),
  0 missing files, **0 warnings** (was 497). 33 tests green.
- Note: `releases: 0` is correct for this set — its release tails live
  after the loop inside each attack WAV, not in separate release files.

Remaining for M2: nothing blocking; wire loader → server at M3 start.
